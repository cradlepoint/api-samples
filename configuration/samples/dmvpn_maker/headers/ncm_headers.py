This file stores API headers used by the samples. The samples call
the dictionary in this script to retrieve them.  You can store multiple
header dictionaries here and call the one you want to use in your script.

IN PRODUCTION:
You may not want to store your keys in plaintext in a source code file.
You can just replace myheaders with code to securely retrieve your
keys from wherever you keep them.
