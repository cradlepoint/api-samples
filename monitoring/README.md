# api-samples
This folder contains examples for common use cases of the NetCloud API. The "samples" folder contains
sample code for individual endpoints. These samples call common code helper classes and functions
from the "utils" folder.

These samples are intended to demonstrate some best practices and points you should consider when 
writing your own scripts for a production environment.  While the sample code may be close to 
what you need, you should make sure you understand, modify as necessary, and test it 
thoroughly in your environment before deploying it.
